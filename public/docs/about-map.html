  The BikeTag Project was started in 2018 as a tool for making the playing of the BikeTag
  Game easier on Reddit (r/CyclePDX) and was a simple form with two pictures and a couple of
  textboxes. The website was a form and an archive of all previously posted tag images.
  Since the launch of BikeTag 2.0 (the app you are using now) we now support the ability to set,
  save, and update GPS locations for BikeTag posts both newly created and of old.
